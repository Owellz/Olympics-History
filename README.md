I used mySQL server to manipulate ad analyze the olympic history data set i exported to the server. I began to build out the datasee by ensuring data cleansing before importig the data into my dataase for analyzes. My primary aim of choosing this data set is to explore detailed know how on SQL functions. Also, i needed to have hadson a 120 years of Olympics History dataset, which i found interesting. From these sets, i randomly scooped out of the data set for exploration.
