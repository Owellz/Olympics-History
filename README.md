I used the MySQL server to manipulate and analyze the Olympic history data set I exported to the server. I began to build out the dataset by ensuring data cleaning using the spreadsheet to transform the data using TRIM to remove unwanted spaces AND ROUNDUP to round up decimals before importing the data into my database for analysis. My primary aim in choosing this data set is to explore detailed know-how on SQL functions. Also, I needed to have hands-on 120 years of the Olympics History dataset, which I found interesting. From these sets, I randomly scooped out 1,000 data sets for exploration.
