I used mySQL server to manipulate and analyze the olympic history data set i exported to the server. I began to build out the datasee by ensuring data cleaning using the spreedsheet to transform the data using TRIM to remove unwanted spaces AND ROUNDUP to round up decimals before importig the data into my dataase for analyzes. My primary aim of choosing this data set is to explore detailed know how on SQL functions. Also, i needed to have hadson on a 120 years of Olympics History dataset, which i found interesting. From these sets, i randomly scooped out 1,000 data set for exploration.
